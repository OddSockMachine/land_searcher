# Land Searcher

My partner and I are looking to buy a farm, villa, or empty land in the Mediterranean. Until we get some spare time for a roadtrip, most of our "house-hunting" is done online. There are loads of sites advertising properties, but keeping track of all the different listings is difficult.

I built this to keep track of the most suitable properties - the cheapest, largest and best value - and to provide updates on any new listings recently added.

Next, we'll plot these on a map to see the best areas (and maybe applying the Travelling Salesman to help plan our roadtrip)
